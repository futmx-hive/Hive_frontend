The importance of getting the right information on the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for proper health decisions making and government websites are important sources for this information dissemination. This project evaluates the usability and accessibility of three COVID-19 information websites in Nigeria which are the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control(NCDC), the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research(NIMR) and the Federal Ministry of Health(FMH).  The accessibility evaluation was done by using four automated tools which are Achecker, WAVE, TAW and Mobile SEO while the usability evaluation was done using Markov Chain Model. The results obtained show that all the COVID-19 information websites have accessibility issues which violates the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). The user testing probability transition matrix obtained are: 0.48, 0.36, 0.16 for NCDC, 0.32, 0.28, 0.40 for NIMR and 0.20, 0.24, 0.56 for FMH respectively. These results were further used to the model the Markov Chain. The results obtained from the Markov Chain model after testing for possible sequence of state are (0.02150, 0.00041617, 0.00000085569), (0.0256, 0.00046242, 0.00000076980) and (0.053760, 0.0012485, 0.0000019245) for NCDC, NIMR and FMH respectively. FMH website has the highest probability value for all days tested. It is therefore recommended that these information websites be designed with international standard guidelines to avoid usability and accessibility issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTABLE OF CONTENTS\t\n\nCOVER

issue among designers and developers all over the world, and recent research in communication, the internet, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has significantly improved information availability and modified the way knowledge is distributed, learnt, and transmitted (Sandnes, 2021). However, despite novel approaches and technical developments, accessibility constraints continue to pose a serious challenge to a significant percentage of target users. Individuals who access information via the internet or other significant resources are typically presented with interfaces that, while allowing access to the information, require either explicit experience or competence on the part of the user. In the software development life cycle, graphical user interfaces are designed to improve usability and the user's experience, making user interaction intuitive, flexible, and efficient (EL-firjani et al., 2017). \n\nAccording to the international standard ISO 9241-11, usability can be defined as “the extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by specific users to achieve specific goals in a specific context with efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction” (ISO, 2018). It also refers to the value of a user's involvement when engaging with systems such as websites, software, applications or gadgets. \n\nMeanwhile Mvungi and  Tossy (2015) propose that the notion of usability is difficult to describe because it is utilised in a variety of situations, including performance, execution period, and user contentment, as well as learning suitability. According to Penedo et al. (2012), the goal of usability testing is to assess a system's ability to be useful to the people who will use it. It's crucial to remember that the system interface is the most accessible element because it's the instrument that a user uses to complete a task. Usability refers to how easy a website is to use, how efficient it is at accomplishing a certain goal, and how contented end-users feel about it. (Joo et al., 2011). \n\nIt's critical to distinguish between summative and formative usability goals and approaches. According to the summative conception, a product is used when people can use it for its intended purpose effectively, efficiently, and with a sense of satisfaction. Usability is dependent on the absence of usability difficulties, based on the formative idea. (Lewis, 2014). \n\nPeople can easily obtain information and make informed decisions about all parts of life, including health-related issues, with the help of a quality website. People from different ages and backgrounds seek health information, and the sheer amount of information available, as well as the need to comprehend technical and complex features, might overwhelm a searcher (Inthiran, 2017). The accessibility of public health platforms allows vital information to get to many individual in a short period. This is especially helpful in the case of a community health emergency, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak. People are looking for reliable COVID-19 information that they can interact with on the internet, therefore these health websites are the main source of information (Howe et al., 2021). \n\nThroughout the COVID-19 outbreak, Yu (2021) opined believes that technology has been crucial in letting governments and other public health agencies to engage with the people  and that several websites were created to monitor the disease's impact and provide prevention strategies.\n\n1.2\tStatement of the Problem \n\nUsability is critical for any website that delivers sensitive information, since if it has a strong feature but poor usability, users will be unable to utilise it properly and would eventually disregard it, losing access to critical information. Websites must meet the dual requirements of usability and accessibility in order to be usable (Adepoju et al., 2019). Ever since the internet has become a major source of information, there are many concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic's ambiguous information. People's ability to absorb health-related information also varies and is reliant on their ability to read and interpret information. A well-designed website with all of the necessary and important information will be extremely beneficial to the general public. The majority of public health websites where people go to get information about the COVID-19 pandemic are not up to standard; some features are not working, and the interface is not well-structured, resulting in usability and accessibility issues for potential users. Therefore, the statement problem of this research is to carry out an accessibility and usability evaluation on COVID-19 information websites in Nigeria using Online Automated tools and Markov Chain Model.  \n\n1.3\tAim and Objectives   \n\nThe research aims to evaluate the accessibility and usability of COVID-19 information websites in Nigeria using automated tools and Markov Chain and this will be achieved through the following objectives: \n\nTo identify the COVID-19 information websites. \n\nTo perform accessibility evaluation on the websites using automated tools\n\nTo evaluate the probability of the website’s usability using the Markov Chain model. \n\nTo discover the possible sequence of visiting each website. \n\n1.4\tSignificance of the Study \n\nThe right to information is one of a citizen's numerous rights; when citizens have access to facts and data from governments, it is more difficult for them to make poor judgments. The importance of this study project work is for Nigerian residents to have access to the necessary knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic, which is required to make appropriate decisions promptly, particularly in the area of health. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted daily routines, a recognised platform must be made available so that real-time information may be transmitted to individuals.\n\nThis information is intended to raise public awareness about the symptoms, prevention, and travel advice for residents, as well as to avoid misinformation. Users will likely be able to navigate through websites and find relevant information on the COVID-19 pandemic in the lowest amount of time if they have a functional website.\n\n1.5\tScope and Limitation of the Study\n\nThe scope of this work is basically on the usability and accessibility of COVID-19 information websites. Three government-owned websites used in the study are the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), the Federal Ministry of Health (FMH), Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). This work is limited to user interaction with the websites to access information on COVID-19 only, other areas such as website management, security, financing, maintenance and other health information provided are not considered. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n\tLITERATURE REVIEW\t\n\n2.1\tHuman­-Computer Interaction\n\nHuman-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of the interaction between humans and computer systems. HCI concepts and research aim to better comprehend the many principles that humans use to connect with computer systems, as well as to investigate new ways of building computer-based interfaces to increase usability and overall user experience (Sinha et al., 2010). The term was propagated by Stuart K. Card, Allen Newell and Thomas P. Morgan in their seminal 1983 book, “The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction”. \n\nHCI is a multidisciplinary area of study that includes cognitive psychology, behavioural science, anthropology, computer science, industrial engineering, sociology, and communication, among others (Waddell et al., 2016). More research in this area will continue to expand as more technical designs and systems are produced regularly. The level of activity that a user has with a machine should be carefully addressed while designing a website. The user's activity is divided into three categories: physical, cognitive, and effective. The physical region governs human-computer interaction, the cognitive area considers how users can comprehend and interact with the system, and the effective area considers not only the user's experience but also how they utilise the computer.\n\nHCI aids in defining the difference between good and poor software, but it does not provide a strategy for creating a successful software product. HCI's long-term goal is to create systems that reduce the gap between humans' cognitive models of what they wish to achieve and the computer's comprehension of the user's task. (Sinha et al., 2010).\n\n2.2\tUsability\n\nUsability has long been a focus of website study by usability professionals because it is primarily concerned with user behaviour. Usability is defined as the easiness with which a product is used, and the product can be either hardware or software. Usability is the basic connection between the makers and end-users of a product, whether they are customers or other users with a connection to the services (Adepoju & Shehu, 2014). Usability is a characteristic that refers to how user interfaces should be used. It also refers to strategies for making the design process more user-friendly. \n\nUsability incorporates a range of aspects from numerous viewpoints, including effectiveness, efficiency, and memorability, to name a few, with a focus on interface design (Joo et al., 2011). The intended users, as well as the tasks to be completed, must be identified to establish usability attributes. Usability attributes according to (Nielsen, 2003) are:\n\nMemorability: How easy is it for users to re-establish easy usage when they return to the design after a period of inactivity? It is a feature of a system that allows users to return to it after a lengthy period without having to relearn how to use it.\n\nEfficiency: This is the ease with which a person may do a task after becoming familiar with the system. The maximum number of tasks a user may do in a given amount of time while using the system.\n\nSatisfaction: A user's exciting experience as a result of using a system design. This is the most difficult to conclude because it is based on the system subjective user's view.\n\nLearnability: How simple it is for users to complete fundamental activities for the first time, as well as how quickly they may achieve a specific degree of proficiency with the system.\n\nErrors: How many errors do users make, how tough are these errors, and how easily do they recover from system failures?\n\n2.3\tUsability Evaluation \n\nThere is a need to gain access to designs and evaluate the systems that arise. This is necessary to ensure that the systems or websites comply with the standard and suit the needs of the users. The importance of evaluation is that it should be carried out throughout the design lifespan, with the results of the evaluation being utilised to modify the design. The evaluation's objectives include defining the scope and accessibility of the system's capabilities, evaluating the end-user experience of the interaction, finding any system flaws, and measuring users' satisfaction with the system's use.\n\nAccording to Mvungi and Tossy (2015) “usability evaluation” refers to the full test, including the planning, carrying out, and presentation of the results. Evaluations of usability and accessibility can be divided into the following categories:\n\nAutomated checking of conformance to guidelines and standards\n\nEvaluations conducted by professionals\n\nEvaluations using models and simulations\n\nEvaluations with users or potential users.\n\n2.4\tUsability Evaluation Methods\n\nThere are generally three types of usability evaluation methods: Testing, Inspection, and Inquiry (Aziz et al., 2021). According to  Adepoju and Shehu (2015), the evaluation of websites can be classified in many different ways. It could be inspection-based, including experts; test-based, involving users; or automated tool-based, involving the use of online automated tools. The Inspection-based method involves the use of a usability expert to assess a website. Users are used in the test-based method via questionnaires, surveys, and user tasks. Generally, it was proposed by (Grigera et al., 2017) that website evaluation techniques could be categorized into:\n\nUser-based usability evaluation methods\n\nEvaluator-based usability evaluation methods\n\n Automated website evaluation tools. \n\n2.4.1\tUser-Based Usability Evaluation Methods\n\nThe user evaluation technique consists of a set of methodologies that use representative people to perform certain activities on a given system. After that, the user's performance and satisfaction with the interface are recorded. User testing is the most useful method for this method.\n\n2.4.1.1\tUser Testing\n\nRiihiaho (2018) opined that user testing is a method in which one or more sample users at a time perform tasks or describe their intentions under observation.. The purpose is to discover any usability problems, gather quantitative and qualitative data, and establish the level of approval with the product or system among the respondents. To conduct a successful usability test, you must first create a strong test plan, then recruit people, then analyse and report your results.\n\nUsability testing gives the design and development teams the opportunity to see issues before system or websites coded. The earlier problems are discovered and resolved, the less expensive the remedies which in turn, saves time. During usability testing, the following is achieved: \n\nEvaluate whether or not participants can complete defined tasks. \n\nDetermine how long it takes to accomplish specified tasks\n\nAsses out how pleased participants are with the website. \n\nIdentify the improvements required to improve user performance and satisfaction\n\nAnd analyse the performance to see if it meets your usability goals. \n\n2.4.1.2   Questionnaires\n\nIt is the most often utilised survey approach. Questionnaires are a set of open-ended or closed-ended questions to which participants respond. The Questionnaire can be administered via phone, mail, live in a public place or an institute, electronic mail or fax, and other means (Kabir, 2016). However, questionnaires cannot determine which portions of a product, software, or website need to be repaired, and questionnaire grading systems can be difficult (Davis et al., 2020). \n\nJeff and Lewis (2016) in their book ‘Standardized Usability Questionnaires’ opined that categories of usability questionnaires include but are not limited to the following: \n\nSystem Usability Scale (SUS): This is a typical, dependable, simple, low-cost usability scale that can be used for subjective testing of system usability assessments. It consists of ten questions, each of which is rated on a 5-point Likert scale based on the degree of agreement.\n\nComputer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ): This is a quick and credible questionnaire created by IBM. CSUQ is made up of 19 questions. Each question is a statement with a rating from “Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree” on a seven-point scale. CSUQ assesses three variables: system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality.\n\nWebsite Analysis and Measurement Inventory (WAMMI): This is a web analytics platform that measures and analyses website user contentment. It is the most effective tool for evaluating user experience as it relates to the experience that visitors have on a website. It consists of 20 questions drawn from a broad pool of questions about users' experiences with websites. It is determined by five criteria: attractiveness, controllability, efficiency, usefulness, and learnability.\n\nPost-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ): This is made up of 19 questions that are assessed on a 7-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The questionnaire tackles usability components such as faster accomplishment of work, learning ease, documentation, good quality internet resources, functional appropriateness, rapid attainment of usability professionals, and prompt acquisition of many user groups.\n\nHealth Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES): This questionnaire category is a customisable usability evaluation tool in which respondents are asked to rate 20 questions on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The questionnaire is built around four scales: quality of work life, perceived utility, supposed ease of use, and complete user control.\n\nQuestionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS): This questionnaire is obtainable in five languages: English, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian and Spanish. The modern version of the QUIS (7.0) includes the demographic section, a measure of overall system approval with six scales, and screen components, terminology and system feedback, learning factors, and system capabilities are nine particular interface factors measured.\n\nComputer Usability Satisfaction Inventory (CUSI): CUSI is the first standardised questionnaire, comprising of a 22-item questionnaire and two subscales: one for effect and one for competence.\n\nSingle Ease Question (SEQ): The SEQ questionnaire asks participants to rate the overall ease of completing a task; some assessors use a 5-point version of this scale, but a sevens-point version is mostly preferred.\n\nSubjective Mental Effort Question (SMEQ): The SMEQ is a single item questionnaire with a assessment scale of 0 to 150 with nine categories starting from ‘not at all difficult to do' to ‘extremely difficult to accomplish. \n\nExpectation Rating (ER): The ER questionnaire compares how simple or difficult a task was after a participant completed it to how they believed it was before they started.\n\n2.4.1.3   Survey\t\n\nA survey is a means of getting information from website or software users. It collects data through questionnaires, interviews, or documents. This method can be used to reflect users' attitudes on a software or product, test concepts, and determine user satisfaction levels. It applies to both quantitative and qualitative research. The survey can be conducted via mail, telephone, personal interview, or electronic interview. A survey, as opposed to observation, can produce more results.\n\n2.4.2\tEvaluator-Based Usability Evaluation Methods\n\nHeuristics evaluation and expert review are examples of evaluator-based evaluation approaches. Usability specialists analyse the website's or platform interface and compare it to acknowledged usability criteria during a heuristic evaluation.\n\n2.4.2.1    Nielsen’s Heuristics Evaluation\n\nThough several groups have produced heuristics, Nielsen's collection developed in 1994 is one of the most well-known. The updated Nielsen's Heuristics according to (Nielsen, 2020) include the following:\n\nSystem Visibility: The system should always provide an appropriate feedback to the users per stage. \n\nMatch between system and the real world: The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\n\nUser control and freedom: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.\n\nConsistency and standards: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.\n\nError prevention: A thorough design to avoid an issue from arising in the first place is much better than effective error messages. Either exclude error-prone situations or check for them and provide users with a confirmation choice before committing to an action.\n\nRecognition rather than recall: Make objects, actions, and options visible to reduce the user's memory load. The user should not have to recall information from one section of the chat to the next. When applicable, system instructions should be visible or easily accessible.\n\nFlexibility and efficiency of use: Though unseen by the beginner user, accelerators may frequently speed up the interaction for the expert user, allowing the system to accommodate both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to personalise frequently performed tasks.\n\nAesthetic and Simple design: Dialogues should not include material that is irrelevant or is only used infrequently. Every additional unit of information in a conversation competes with the relevant pieces of information and reduces their relative exposure.\n\nHelp users recognize, identify, and recover from faults: Error messages should be written in clear language (no codes), accurately describe the problem, and constructively propose a remedy.\n\nHelp and documentation: Although it is preferable if the system can be utilised without documentation, assistance and documentation may be required. Any such resource should be easy to find, concentrate on the user's task, describe concrete steps to be taken, and not too big.\n\n2.4.2.2   Expert Review\n\nThis method involves a small group of professionals evaluating the user interface design against a set of usability standards. This strategy can help provide fast feedback, and professionals can offer remedies to any usability difficulties that arise (Davis et al., 2020). The downside of this strategy is that several experts may be difficult to find and expensive to hire. Among experts, there may be a non-existence of uniformity or similarity in the found usability concerns.\n\n2.5    Automated Website Evaluation Tools\n\nAutomated evaluation software, also known as a validator, evaluator, and online validator, reads a web page's code and verifies its content for accessibility. These tools aid in determining whether a given interface was designed following accessibility requirements and they include but are not limited to Achecker, WAVE, TAW, FAE, Eval Access, Mobile SEO. \n\nSome of the free automatic accessibility validation software applications available online meet the minimum selection criteria. – i.e., compliance with the standard recommendations of both WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0. (Pivetta et al., 2014)  \n\n2.6\tWeb Usability\n\nWeb usability is a method of testing whether or not websites are easy to use by end-users without the need for adequate training or learning how to use them (Adepoju et al., 2016). Website usability is an important aspect of a website since it determines whether or not the site is interactive.\n\n2.7\tWeb Accessibility\n\nWeb accessibility refers to how end-users and individuals with disabilities may access, perceive, comprehend, navigate, and engage with the internet. Others, like the elderly with changing capacities, can benefit from web accessibility as well. The most important premise of Web accessibility is the creation of websites and software that are adaptable to various user needs, interests, and scenarios. Web accessibility encompasses all limitations that impede web access, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, and neurological impairments.\n\nPark et al. (2015) opined that when accessibility is assured, people with physical and cognitive disabilities, such as the disabled and elderly, can readily use equipment and services and access content. \n\nWeb Accessibility Initiative (WAI) founded by the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) to promote online accessibility, which is the major international standards body for the Internet, defines web accessibility as the ability of individuals with impairments to utilise the web. It means that people with disabilities can perceive, comprehend, interact, and navigate the environment (Adepoju & Shehu, 2014).  \n\nFurthermore, web accessibility implies that everyone utilising any type of web surfing technology must be able to visit any site and fully comprehend the information as well as communicate with the site if necessary (Oluwatobi et al., 2014).\n\n2.7.1\tWebsite Content Accessibility Guidelines\n\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines elucidate how to make web content more accessible to individuals with impairments (Henry, 2021). Accessibility encompasses a broad spectrum of disabilities, including but not limited to speech, physical, language, and learning difficulties. It is an internationally recognised standard that comprises specific standards that outline how to create an accessible website. WCAG 1.0 which was released on December 11, 2008 contains fourteen guidelines, WCAG 2.0 which was released on June 5, 2018 contains twelve guidelines structured around four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. WCAG 2.2 is expected to be released before the end of 2021. \n\nPerceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This connotes that every detail on the interface must be visible to all of the user senses. \n\nOperable: User interface modules and navigation must be operable. This means that users must be able to interact with the website conveniently. \n\nUnderstandable: Information and the user interface must be understood by users. It means that users must be able to understand every bit of information on the website interface. \n\nRobust: Information on the website must be robust so that it can be assessed and interpreted by the users despite technological advancement.  \n\n2.8\tMarkov Chain Model\n\nA Markov Chain is the most basic type of Markov Model where all states can be observed, and probability converges over time. At transition period, a Markov Chain Model is a probabilistic procedure that goes from a state to another (Kuperberg, 2018). The transition statistical properties define the Markov Chain Model and allow state ordering.\n\nA random transition process  } is a collection of random variables. The index j represents time, while X(j) represents the state of the transition at time j. If J is countably infinite, then we can say X a discrete-time transition process else it is called a continuous-time process. \n\n2.8.1\tDiscrete Markov Chains (DMC)\n\nA Discrete Markov chain (DMC) is a probabilistic model whose parameter space is discrete such as S: = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ……}. A Discrete Markov Chains (DMC) state space states that the Markov property consisting of random variables Xj with j ∈ J (X0 = S0 is the beginning state) such that: \n\nP (Xn = Sn| X0 = S0, X1 = S1, X2 = S2, X3 = S3………...Xn-1 = Sn-1)                                        (2.1)\n\nFor homogenous Markov chain, the transition probability process from state i at time t to state m at time w is determined solely by the distance w-t amongst both states and is unaffected by real values of t or w, which is formally defined as \n\n                                                                              (2.2)\n\n2.8.2\tContinuous Markov Chains (CMC)\n\nA Continuous Markov Chain (CMC) allows for state modifications at any point in phase transition, resulting in a continuous state space S: = [0, ∞], but state space remains distinct. The defined Markov property for Continuous Markov Chain is stated as; assuming an increase in the state sequence 0 ≤ S0 < S1 < S2 < S3 < S4 < . . . < Sm−1 < Sm, gives the requirement that \n\nP(Xsm) = Xm| X(sm-1) =Xm-1,………X(s0) =X0) =P(Xsm) =Xm| X(sm-1) =Xm-1).                        (2.3)\n\nIn summary, a Markov chain is defined entirely by two structures.\n\ni. The vector P(Xs0) = {k| k = 0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5. . .} that encompasses the first probabilities P (Xs0 = k) for all states k at interval S0\n\nii. The state change probabilities, given as:\n\nPij (t, v) = P(X(v) = j|X(t) = i)                                                                                                    (2.4)\n\nRemember; ∀i, 0 ≤ t ≤ v the random possibilities must satisfy Ʃj∈I Pij (t, v) = 1.\n\n2.9\tCOVID-19 Information Websites in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, three government-owned platforms are saddled with the responsibility of providing the citizens with accurate and real-time based information on the COVID-19 pandemic. They are the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), the Federal Ministry of Health (FMH) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nNigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) \n\nNigeria Institute of Medical Research was established in 1977, the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research investigates illnesses of public health significance in Nigeria and the website is http://www.nimr.gov.ng/. \n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Ministry of Health (FMH)\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Health was established for the provision of high-quality health-care services to all Nigerians through the development and implementation of policies that strengthen the national health-care system and the website is https://www.health.gov.ng/\n\nNigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was formed in 2011 in response to the problems of public health emergencies and to improve Nigeria's preparedness and response to epidemics through communicable disease prevention, detection, and control. and website is https://ncdc.gov.ng/\n\n2.10\tRelated Works\n\nAkinola and Temilola (2012) carried out a usability evaluation of twenty-five Nigerian university websites. Their result showed that the usability index of the website ranged between 65 to 84 per cent which is actually below the recommended 90 to 100 per cent usability index. \n\nAdepoju and Osofisan (2008) conducted a study on the usability of three Nigeria university websites. The websites tested are futy.edu.ng, futa.edu.ng and futonigeria.net. User testing and questionnaire were used to collect data to determine their efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction with the websites. Their result indicated that futa.edu.ng performed best amongst the three websites. \n\nAdepoju and Shehu (2015) carried out research work on usability assessment of educational websites using three online automated tools which are Web Accessibility checker, HERA and WAVE. The results produced showed that all the websites are not in compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0 and 2.0) and recommendations for improvement were provided. \n\nAdepoju et al. (2016) performed an accessibility assessment and performance analysis of Nigerian electronic government websites using two open-source automated tools TAW and site analyser were used with the result showing that most websites performed above average. \n\nAl-Khalifa (2010) used the heuristic evaluation technique to conduct research on the usability of fourteen Saudi government websites. The findings revealed that none of the six specified modules were entirely met by the websites.\n\n Dongaonkar et al. (2017) investigated the content accessibility assessment of Government website using automated tools based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The efficiency and drawback of each automated tool were thoroughly analysed. \n\nFernandez et al. (2011) did paperwork on a systematic mapping study on Usability evaluation methods for the web. The results show that around 39% of the papers reviewed reported the use of evaluation methods that had been specifically crafted for the Web. \n\nAsiimwe and Lim (2010) carried out the usability of four Government websites in Uganda using a feature investigation method based on three perspectives. Their result showed that the websites are not totally usable in the design layout and navigation perspectives. \n\nGrigera et al., (2017) did research on web usability using a tool called Kabold to detect usability problems. The tool was shown to perform averagely well. \n\nHasan et al., (2012) evaluated e-commerce websites using a comparative analysis of usability evaluation methods. Their result depicted that user testing uniquely identified major problems on the websites. \n\nHuang and Benyoucef (2014) presented a research paper that evaluates the usability and credibility of current e-government websites and looks at user performance while using these websites using heuristic evaluation technique. The result presented showed many usability weaknesses on the sampled government websites. \n\nHuang (2020) researched the usability of tourism websites using heuristic evaluation. The findings demonstrate major usability flaws such as poor navigation, difficulties performing activities, an overwhelming presentation of alternatives, incorrect item name, and a lack of warning indicators.\n\nLewis (2018) did paperwork primarily to look at the relationship between two frequently used questionnaires for measuring perceived usability: the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The result showed that the difference is statistically significant.\n\nKaraim and Inal (2017) carried out usability and accessibility on Libyan government websites and the result showed that the tested websites did have a lot of usability issues. \n\nChang and Almaghalsah (2020) presented research work on usability assessment of Taiwan electronic government websites using questionnaire technique. The results indicate that several usability problems have been found in the target e-government websites. \n\nIsmailova and Inal (2018) carried out a comparative analysis of usability evaluation of top university websites from Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkey using automated assessment tools. The result revealed that the majority of the university websites in the study did not meet the WCAG 2.0 accessibility criteria. \n\nVerkijika and De Wet (2018), did a usability assessment of two hundred and seventy-nine electronic government websites in thirty-one Sub-Saharan Africa using heuristic evaluation and automated usability methods. The result showed that the average usability score for the websites was 36.2%, with the most usable website having a score of only 64.8%.\n\nPenedo et al., (2012) researched on usability evaluation of the learning system in its pre-design phase using the Markov model. The result produced was recommendations on how to improve the user interface design. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1\tIntroduction\n\nThis chapter explains the methodology used in the evaluation process, these include free online automated tools, user testing method and the Markov chain model.  \n\n3.2    Analysis of the Existing Websites\n\nThere are three government-owned websites in this research and they are, Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), the Federal Ministry of Health (FMH) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The goal of these websites is to offer the public with health-related information, including details about COVID-19.  The English language is the write-up language used on these websites, the contents of the website consist of text, images, JavaScript, CSS files and many more, and theme colours are included. \n\n3.3\tWebsites Categories\n\nHealth information websites being a crucial part of sensitizing the public will contain the following section just like any website. \n\nOrganization, contents and readability\n\nNavigation and hyperlinks\n\nDesign of the user interface\n\nPerformance and effectiveness\n\n3.4      Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation metrics to be considered are task performance efficiency and user satisfaction. The main goal of evaluation is to study the effect interfaces have on end-users and identify specific problems with the use of these websites. A Markov Chain model will be used to interpret these evaluation metrics outcomes from a Markov chain. \n\n3.5    Methodology\n\nThis research project aims to perform an accessibility and usability evaluation of COVID-19 information websites in Nigeria. The evaluation was done using: \n\nOnline automated accessibility evaluation tools\n\nUser testing method\n\nMarkov Chain model\n\nThe research methodology steps used in the project is depicted in figure 3.1 below. For the Accessibility evaluation, selection of websites to be used was first carried out, followed by the online automated tool selection then the result and analysis was done. \n\nFor the usability evaluation, the first step was to identify the websites to perform the evaluation on, second step was data collection via user testing with 25 users in the school library then a qualitative evaluation was carried out on user website’s order of preference based on user satisfaction and task performance efficiency. The data preparation stage involved the transformation of the data collected into a probability distribution matrix which was used for the model building using python programming language in a Jupyter notebook integrated development environment(IDE). The next stage was model testing for possible sequence of states then result and analysis based on the test results obtained. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsites Selection\n\nModel Testing\n\nModel Building\n\nData Preparation\n\nData Collection via User Testing\n\nAccessibility Evaluation using Online Automated Tools\n\nAutomated Tools Selection\n\nResult and Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Research Methodology Steps\n\n3.5.1   Online Automated Tools\n\nThese are tools that are used to assess the usability and accessibility of websites by running and reviewing them through evaluation software. The results obtained would enable the website designers to improve the usability and accessibility of their websites. The following are the online automated technologies tools used in this project work.\n\nWAVE: It means Web Accessibility and Versatile Evaluator, it is a free online tool developed by webAIM with chrome and Firefox browser. It finds empty links on websites and contrasts links, faults, and features.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: WAVE Homepage\n\nTAW: CTIC (Centro Tecnologico Italiano) developed this evaluation tool. It highlights the major accessibility problems that it finds by delivering a marked up version of the website as well as suggestions on possible ways of resolving the problem. \n\nFigure 3.3: TAW Homepage\n\nAchecker: Accessibility checker is an online accessibility assessment tool, developed in 2005 in University of Toronto, Canada by the research group named Inclusive Design Centre(IDC). The evaluator can use this tool to submit a webpage via its URL (uniform resource locator) and then choose the rules to analyse it against, including the HTML validator, WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 standard.\n\nFigure 3.4:  Achecker Homepage.\n\nMobile SEO: Mobile SEO depicts Mobile Search Engine Optimization, it is an online accessibility assessment tool that evaluates the mobile-friendliness, mobile speediness, google access, and web page redirection of a website. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Mobile SEO Homepage\n\n3.5.2 User-testing\n\nThis is the second phase of the evaluation; it is a direct approach to testing the websites with users. Users are asked to complete activities, generally while being observed by a moderator, in order to determine where they face difficulty and confusion. Time taken by each user to carry out each specific task was documented via a screen recorder and qualitative evaluation was carried out based on how the user will prefer to source information starting from each website. The following tasks are assigned to the respondents: \n\nCheck for the latest update on COVID-19\n\nCheck for local/ international travel protocol.\n\nSearch for the contact address of each website\n\nApply to get tested for COVID-19. \n\nApply for vaccination\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3\tMarkov Chain Model\n\nIn a Markov Chain, the future state is determined solely by the present state and not by the past state. The data collected by the user testing method which is the website they will likely visit based on the task performance efficiency and user satisfaction by the users to perform the tasks was transformed into a transition probability matrix which was used to evaluate the COVID-19 government websites and the model was implemented with Python programming language. \n\nFor the transition probability matrix, if there are M states, a transition matrix D is an M x M matrix where\n\n= (1 if a user action transforms state i to state j, and 0 otherwise).\n\nIn Markov modelling, the probability that an end-user will move to the next state from the current state is given by\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                      (3.1)\n\nWhere\n\nis the future state;\n\nis the current state;\n\nis the probability matrix generated from the data collected. \n\nAlso, each row in the probability transition matrix must not be greater than 1, i.e; P() <=1. \n\n                                                                             \n\nAij =                                                  \t                     (3.2)                                                           \n\nA Markov chain with state-space S and transition matrix P can be represented by a directed graph  as depicted in figure 3.6 where V represents the vertices and E represents the edges (states). \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: State Diagram of a Transition Matrix\n\n3.5.4   Programming Language\n\nThe programming language used for the Markov Chain modelling is Python. Packages used in the python library are Panda library, Random library and Numpy library. The panda and NumPy libraries were used to work on the transition probability matrix generated and the random library is used to forecast the states transition possible based on the transition matrix of the data collected. \n\n\n\n3.5.4.1\tJupyter Notebook\n\nJupyter Notebook is an open-source web software and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for live code implementation. This platform provides a simple and interactive environment and the usage includes data cleansing and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, and machine learning are all examples of applications of machine learning. The implementation of the Markov Chain model was carried out on the Jupyter Notebook platform using Python programming language. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n4.1\tOnline Automated Tool Results\n\nThe result of the four online automated tools which include WAVE, Mobile SEO, TAW, Achecker used for accessibility evaluation of the COVID-19 websites in Nigeria are shown below;\n\n4.2\tWAVE Analysis Tool\n\nWAVE is a tool made to help developers design more accessible websites, WAVE is easy to use, simply enter the web page address at the space provided at the home interface and submit the form. Each icon, box and piece of information added by WAVE present some information about the accessibility of the page to be checked. \n\nThe report session at the top of the page displays whether or not WAVE detected any errors. The absence of errors does not imply that the page submitted for review is accessible. Accessibility issues are indicated by red symbols. The presence of green icons indicates the presence of accessibility features. The other icons and indications suggest further elements that should be examined. WAVE makes it easy to analyse a website's accessibility information in context.\n\nWAVE's element indications are missing alternative text, linked image missing, spacer image missing alternate text, missing from the label, and empty links are errors, as are suspicious link text, redundant link, form label for structural elements heading level one to four, no script element, very small text, unordered list and inline frame. Navigation, search, Aside, ARIA label description, and ARIA tab index are HTML and ARIA indicators.\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: WAVE analysis and Result for COVID-19 information websites\n\nWebsites\n\nError\n\nAlerts\n\nFeatures\n\nStructural elements\n\nAria\n\nContrast Error\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng \n\n41\n\n9\n\n41\n\n42\n\n169\n\n28\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng \n\n8\n\n71\n\n44\n\n89\n\n360\n\n74\n\nwww.health.gov.ng \n\n7\n\n89\n\n125\n\n52\n\n0\n\n148\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: WAVE analysis and results of COVID-19 information websites\n\nWAVE checks for conformity of WCAG 2.0 AA and WCAG 2.0A and section 508. Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1 show the COVID-19 websites Errors, Contrast Errors, Alerts, Features, Structural Elements and ARIA. NCDC has the highest average errors of 41 while the Federal Ministry of Health has the lowest average error of 7, and the COVID-19 website information with the highest average alerts of 89 is FMH while the lowest average alert of 9 is for NCDC. Federal Ministry of Health has the highest average of contrast error of 148 while NCDC has the lowest average of contrast error of 28. FMH has the highest average features of 125 while NCDC has the lowest average features of 41. For the structural elements, NIMR has the highest average of 89 and NCDC has the lowest average of 42. NIMR has the highest average ARIA of 360 while FMH has the lowest average ARIA of 0. From amongst the three websites checked, NCDC happened to show the best result while NIMR showed the worst results as almost all its indicators are extremely high compared to other websites evaluated. \n\n4.3\tTAW Analysis Tool\n\nTAW is an open- source evaluation tool for analysing website accessing, it highlights the accessibility problems that it finds by delivering an annotated version of the website as well as suggestions on how to resolve them. To check a website, this tool employs four principles: perceivable, operable, comprehensible, and robust. TAW evaluation tool guarantees that information and interface components are well presented in an easily perceivable manner, that user interface components and navigation are operable, that the information on the website is understandable, and that the content of the website makes sense.\n\nTable 4.2: TAW PROBLEMS analysis and results for the COVID-19 information websites\n\nProblems\n\nWebsites\n\nPerceivable\n\nOperable\n\nUnderstandable\n\nRobust\n\nTotal\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng\n\n21\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n30\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng\n\n9\n\n5\n\n2\n\n22\n\n38\n\nwww.health.gov.ng\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFigure 4.2: TAW PROBLEMS analysis and result for COVID-19 information websites\n\n\n\nTable 4.2 and figure 4.2 show that the TAW PROBLEMS analysis for the COVID-19 information websites. From the result obtained, NIMR has the highest average problems with a total of 38 while FMH has the lowest average of problems with a total of 1. This implies that NIMR has a lot of correction to do and FMH has little.\n\nTable 4.3: TAW WARNINGS analysis and results for the COVID-19 information websites\n\nWarnings\n\nWebsites\n\nPerceivable\n\nOperable\n\nUnderstandable\n\nRobust\n\nTotal\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng\n\n81\n\n53\n\n6\n\n2\n\n142\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng\n\n118\n\n77\n\n6\n\n31\n\n232\n\nwww.health.gov.ng\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\nFigure 4.3: TAW WARNINGS analysis and result for COVID-19 information websites\n\nTable 4.3 and figure 4.3 show the analysis and result for COVID-19 information websites. From the result obtained, it is obvious that NIMR has the highest average TAW WARNINGS of 232 while FMH has the lowest TAW WARNINGS of 3. This means that NIMR needs a human review to ascertain which is a problem and which is not. \n\nTable 4.4: TAW NOT REVIEWED analysis and results for the COVID-19 information websites\n\nNot Reviewed\n\nWebsites\n\nPerceivable\n\nOperable\n\nUnderstandable\n\nRobust\n\nTotal\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng\n\n3\n\n6\n\n5\n\n0\n\n14\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng\n\n4\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n16\n\nwww.health.gov.ng\n\n4\n\n9\n\n5\n\n1\n\n19\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: TAW NOT REVIEWED analysis and result for COVID-19 information websites\n\n\n\nTable 4.4 and Figure 4.4 show the analysis and result of COVID-19 information websites. From the result displayed, FMH has the highest average of TAW NOT REVIEWED of 19 while NCDC has the lowest TAW NOT REVIEWED of 14.\n\n\n\n4.4\tAchecker Analysis Tool\n\nAchecker is an open-source web accessibility evaluation tool. It can be used to assess the accessibility of web pages under WCAG 2.0 AA. The results of an Achecker evaluation tool can be divided into three categories: known problems, likely problems, and potential problems, and it provides repair recommendations for the known faults. The known problems are ones that Achecker is certain are accessibility issues. The likely problems are those that Achecker has discovered as possible difficulties but cannot be certain of; they must be decided by a human. Finally, potential concerns are those that Achecker cannot successfully discover because the decision is dependent on human intuition or expert assessment.\n\nTable 4.5: Achecker Analysis and Result obtained for the COVID-19 information websites\n\nWebsites\n\nKnown Problems\n\nLikely Problems\n\nPotential Problems\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng\n\n11\n\n0\n\n263\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng\n\n19\n\n0\n\n869\n\nwww.health.gov.ng\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Achecker analysis and result for the COVID-19 information websites.\n\nTable 4.5 and figure 4.5 show the Achecker analysis and result for the COVID-19 information websites. NCDC website has 11 known problems which include text and background colour issues, wrong HTML syntax for images, no likely problem was discovered and 263 potential problems were found. For the NIMR website, the known problems are 19, with 0 likely problems and 869 potential problems. Lastly, FMH website has 0 known problems, 0 likely problems and 0 potential problems. From the result obtained, FMH gave the best result with Achecker while NIMR performed worst. \n\n4.5\tMobile SEO Analysis Tool\n\nMobile SEO is an open-source evaluation tool check website for mobile-friendly, mobile speed, google access and page redirect which involves meta information, page quality, page structure, link structure, server, external factor and the total SEO score. Recommendation tasks list on SEO improvement was also specified for mobile search engine optimization. Meta-information includes title, meta description, domain, language. Page quality summary includes content, mobile optimization, image SEO. Page structure is on headings while link structure is about internal and external links found on each website. The server is on HTTP redirects and the external factor is based on social networks links. \n\nTable 4.6: Mobile SEO analysis and results for the COVID-19 information websites.\n\nWebsites\n\nMeta Information\n\nPage Quality\n\nPage Structure\n\nLink Structure\n\nServer\n\nExternal Factor\n\nSEO Score\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng\n\n95%\n\n64%\n\n79%\n\n0\n\n0\n\n92%\n\n60%\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng\n\n75%\n\n47%\n\n64%\n\n76%\n\n0\n\n92%\n\n56%\n\nwww.health.gov.ng\n\n80%\n\n79%\n\n55%\n\n13%\n\n46%\n\n92%\n\n71%\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Mobile SEO analysis and results for the COVID-19 information websites\n\nTable 4.6 and figure 4.6 show the Mobile SEO analysis and results for the COVID-19 information websites. As displayed in the table above, NCDC has the lowest average score of 75 % for meta-information while FMH has the highest average score of 95%. For page quality, NCDC has the lowest average score of 47%, and NIMR has the highest average score of 79%. FMH has the highest average score of 79% for page structure and NIMR has the lowest average score of 55%. All the evaluated websites displayed the same average score of 92% for the external factor. \n\nFrom the result obtained, the NIMR website has the total highest average SEO score of 71% while the NCDC website has the total lowest average SEO score of 56%. The evaluation tool gave 11 recommendation tasks for the NCDC website which include adding meta descriptions, reducing the number of JavaScript and CSS files. 9 recommendation tasks were specified for the NIMR website which includes amongst others; removing unnecessary heading, improving page response time. Lastly, FMH has 12 recommendation tasks that can be performed for the website mobile optimization.  \n\n4.6\tUsability Testing\n\nFor the user testing, 25 participants were asked to perform 5 tasks on each of the COVID-19 information websites. The time taken in seconds to perform each task by each user was taken note of, then a qualitative evaluation was done to find out each user website’s order of preference based on user satisfaction and task performance efficiency. \n\nTable 4.7: Qualitative user testing transition responses on the choice of COVID-19 information websites\n\nWebsites\n\nMost Preferred\n\nMore Preferred\n\nLeast Preferred\n\nTotal Responses\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.ng\n\n12\n\n 9\n\n4\n\n25\n\nwww.nimr.gov.ng\n\n7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n25\n\nwww.health.gov.ng \n\n14\n\n6\n\n5\n\n25\n\n\n\nTable 4.7 shows the responses of how users will likely transit from a website to another for credible information on COVID-19. Starting with the NCDC website, 48% (12 participants) choose it as their most Preferred choice, 36% (9 participants) choose it as their more preferred option while 16% (4 participants) picked it as their least preferred choice. \n\nFor the NIMR website, 28% (7 participants) choose it as their Most preferred option, 32% (8 participants) made it their more preferred choice and 40% (10 participants) picked the least preferred option. Lastly, for FMH, 56% (14 participants) choose it as the most preferred, 24% (6 participants) picked it for more preferred option and 20% (5 participants) choose it as the least preferred choice of websites. \n\nTable 4.8: Probability Distribution Transition Matrix\n\nStates\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nTotal Probability\n\nA\n\n0.48\n\n0.36\n\n0.16\n\n1\n\nB\n\n0.32\n\n0.28\n\n0.40\n\n1\n\nC\n\n0.20\n\n0.24\n\n0.56\n\n1\n\nTable 4.8 shows the probability transition matrix of the websites based on user responses on task performance efficiency and user satisfaction of each website, which influenced their choice of which COVID-19 website to visit for credible information; State A, B, C represent NCDC website, NIMR website and FMH website respectively. \n\n\n\n0.48\n\n0.32\n\n0.56\n\n\n\n0.40\n\n0.24\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\n                                                        0.36                                         0.16\n\n                                                                       0.28                   0.20\n\n\n\n                                                                                            \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFigure 4.7: State diagram of the transition matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.1\tUsability Model Testing Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Output of 3 days’ transition probability starting from NCDC website\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: State diagram of the 3 days’ transition probability starting from the NCDC website\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9 show the transition probability of a user sourcing for credible information on COVID-19 on the selected websites for 3 days.

Four automated tools were used for the accessibility evaluation while the Markov Chain model was used to tell which website users will most likely visit for information on COVID-19 based on task performance efficiency and user satisfaction.  \n\n5.2\tConclusion\n\nThis research presented a study to evaluate the usability and accessibility of COVID-19 information websites in Nigeria. Compliance with the WCAG 2.0 AA level was comprehensively checked using four automated tools. The result of the accessibility evaluation shows that all selected websites have inherent numbers of errors and a lot of redesigning is needed to be done for easy usability and accessibility of information as regards the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Federal Ministry of Health website still performed better compared to NCDC and NIMR websites, as users preferred to seek information on the website compared to other websites as inferred from the Markov Chain model result. \n\n5.3\tRecommendations\n\nThe government websites which do not have enough information on COVID-19 on their website should include all vital information when necessary to give the populace up to date information about the COVID-19 pandemic. The guideline for building websites should be strictly followed as these websites provide sensitive information and this information should be well arranged in a logical manner that will not be difficult to access which in turn saves time and give the user of these websites in-depth satisfaction. They should also be designed with mobile compatibility in mind for mobile smartphone user who needs on-the-go information on COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nLastly, it is also suggested that the government should make use of expert review to improve the design especially the interface of these websites\n\n5.4\tSuggestions for further work\n\nFurther research work could include using usability automated tools, formative evaluation of the COVID-19 information websites interface while extending the scope and number of users used for testing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAdepoju, S.
